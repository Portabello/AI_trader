Hungarian foreign minister arrives in UkraineElliot SmithThis was CNBC’s live blog tracking developments on the war in Ukraine.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday published his income over a two-year period, as he looks to promote transparency as part of Kyiv’s push for European Union membership.Ukraine formally started the screening process to begin talks over its future membership of the EU on Thursday, and faces stringent conditions to increase transparency and root out corruption.Zelenskyy has called for all public officials to disclose their incomes, while the U.S. and other allies supporting Ukraine’s war effort have sought assurances about the country’s efforts.According to the declaration, the president and his family members received 10.8 million hryvnias ($286,168) in 2021, the last year before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, down 12 million hryvnias from the previous year.

There were no casualties in either strike, according to Regional Governor Philip Pronin.Much of last week was dominated by Moscow and Kyiv trading allegations over the shooting down on Wednesday of a Russian military transport plane that was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war and nine Russians.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday said the aircraft was shot down by Ukrainian air defenses, either on purpose or by mistake, and that preliminary evidence suggested French or U.S. missiles were involved. Putin said in televised comments reported by Reuters that an investigation would be completed in the coming days.18 Hours AgoHungary accuses EU of blackmail over Ukraine aid stand-offHungary accused the European Union of blackmail after a leaked document reportedly suggested that the bloc plans to sabotage Budapest’s economy if it vetoes fresh aid for Ukraine at a summit later this week.Hungary’s minister for EU affairs took to social media to lambast the paper drawn up by EU officials and cited Sunday by the Financial Times, which said that Brussels has developed a strategy to target Hungary’s economic weak spots and undermine investor confidence over its blockade of funds to Kyiv.“Hungary does not give in to blackmail,” Bóka János wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.— Karen Gilchrist20 Hours AgoAt least three killed in rocket strike in Russian-controlled Donetsk, mayor saysA Ukrainian rocket strike in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine on Monday killed at least three civilians and wounded one more, Russian-installed Mayor Alexei Kulemzin announced on Telegram.Multiple unverified pictures and videos had earlier emerged on social media showing a vehicle on fire and several bodies lying in the street.CNBC was not able to independently verify Kulemzin’s claims.21 Hours AgoHungarian foreign minister arrives in Ukraine for ‘frank dialogue’Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó arrived in Uzhhorod, Ukraine, on Monday for talks with senior officials ahead of Thursday’s EU summit, at which the bloc hopes Budapest will sign off on a 50 billion euro ($54 billion) aid package to Ukraine.Andriy Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, shared a photograph on X of the two men sitting opposite one another.“For a better relationship, a frank dialogue is needed. We are ready,” Yermak said.23 Hours AgoHungary ready to allow EU budget to be used for Ukraine aid packageHungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrives for a meeting of European Union EU leaders in Brussels, Belgium, Dec. 14, 2023.Zhao Dingzhe | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesHungary has signaled it is open to using the European Union budget to supply an aid package to Ukraine, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s political director confirmed on Monday.Ahead of an emergency summit on Thursday, Balazs Orban confirmed that Budapest had sent a proposal to Brussels on Saturday indicating that it was ready to compromise on a proposed 50 billion euro ($54 billion) aid package.The prime minister has long been a vocal critic of the EU’s financial and military support for Kyiv and maintained close ties with the Kremlin, previously blocking a revision of the EU budget to include aid for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian invasion.The Financial Times reported on Sunday that the EU has drawn up plans to sabotage Hungary’s economy if Budapest was to thwart a fresh aid package this Thursday.— Elliot SmithMon, Jan 29 20242:59 AM ESTRussian missile strikes Kremenchuk region for second straight dayA Russian missile struck an industrial site in the district of Kremenchuk in central Ukraine on Sunday, after a similar attack the previous day triggered a fire, according to the Poltava regional governor.“According to preliminary information, an industrial facility in the Kremenchuk district has been hit again,” Regional Governor Philip Pronin said on Telegram.“Fortunately, there were no casualties.

The 2021 figure included income from the sale of around $142,000 in government bonds.In 2022, the Zelenskyy family’s income fell to 3.7 million hryvnias due to the “temporary termination of lease agreements on the territory of Ukraine as a result of the beginning of Russia’s full-scale aggression.”The family’s cash balance at the end of 2022 dropped by almost 1.8 million, while there were no other changes across the two years relating to assets, real estate, vehicles etc.Ukraine formally started the screening process to begin talks over its future membership of the EU on Thursday, and faces stringent conditions to increase transparency and root out corruption.Zelenskyy has called for all public officials to disclose their incomes, while the U.S. and other allies supporting Ukraine’s war effort, including the International Monetary Fund, have sought assurances about the country’s efforts to eradicate corruption.— Elliot SmithFri, Jan 26 202411:59 AM ESTPutin says Ukraine shot down plane, not clear if deliberately or in errorA screen grab captured from a video shows the site as officials inspect here, after the military transport plane that crashed in the Belgorod region a day earlier killing all 74 people on board, in Belgorod, Russia on January 25, 2024. Russian Investigative Committee | Anadolu | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin said a Russian military plane that crashed near the border with Ukraine on Wednesday was shot down by Ukrainian air defences, whether on purpose or by mistake.Moscow accuses Kyiv of downing the Ilyushin Il-76 plane in Russia’s Belgorod region and killing 74 people on board, including 65 captured Ukrainian soldiers en route to be swapped for Russian PoWs. It has not presented proof.Ukraine has not confirmed or denied whether it shot down the plane and has challenged Moscow’s account of who was on board and what happened.“I don’t know if they did it on purpose or by mistake, but it is obvious that they did it,” Putin said in televised comments, his first on the crash.A screen grab captured from a video shows the site as officials inspect here, after the military transport plane that crashed in the Belgorod region a day earlier killing all 74 people on board, in Belgorod, Russia on January 25, 2024. Russian Investigative Committee | Anadolu | Getty Images“In any case, what happened is a crime. Either through negligence or on purpose, but in any case it is a crime.”Ukraine disputes Russia’s assertion that it was warned in advance that a plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war would be flying over Russia’s southwestern Belgorod region at that time. It has also said there were discrepancies in a list published by Russian media of the 65 Ukrainians alleged to have been on the aircraft.Putin said the plane could not have been brought down by Russian “friendly fire” because Russia’s air defence systems have safeguards to prevent them attacking their own planes.“There are ‘friend or foe’ systems there, and no matter how much the operator presses the button, our air defence systems would not work,” he said.Putin said the missiles fired were mostly likely American or French, but this would be established with certainty in two to three days.— ReutersFri, Jan 26 202411:29 AM ESTPhotos show traces of destroyed Russian equipment on the outskirts of east Ukraine strongholdPhotos published via Getty Images show recently damaged Russian military equipment on the outskirts of Ukraine’s industrial hub of Avdiivka, which is regarded as the gateway to Donetsk. A snowy field with traces of artillery and recently destroyed Russian heavy equipment on the outskirts of the city on January 25, 2023 in Avdiivka, Ukraine.
